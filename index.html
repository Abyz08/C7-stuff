        </div>
        <div class="content">Exothermic reactions are those that release energy to the surroundings, typically in the form of heat. This release
        results in a temperature increase in the immediate environment. Common examples include combustion reactions, such as
        the burning of fuels, and neutralisation reactions between acids and bases. <br><br></div>

            <div class="titletext">Endothermic Reactions</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">In contrast, endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings, leading to a temperature decrease in the
        environment. An example provided is the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide and carbon
        dioxide. These reactions are essential in various industrial processes and are explained with clear diagrams and
        explanations.<br><br></div>

            <div class="titletext">Energy Profiles</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">Energy profile diagrams visually represent the energy changes during chemical reactions. These
        diagrams show the energy levels of reactants and products, illustrating the activation energy required for a reaction to
        occur. The difference in energy between reactants and products determines whether a reaction is exothermic or
        endothermic.<br><br></div>

            <div class="titletext">Activation Energy</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">Activation energy is the minimum energy required to initiate a chemical reaction. Factors such
        as temperature, concentration, and surface area can influence the activation energy and, consequently, the rate of
        reaction. These factors are crucial in controlling and optimising chemical processes in various industries.<br><br></div>

            <div class="titletext">Applications and Importance</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">Understanding energy changes in chemical reactions is vital for numerous applications. For instance, exothermic
        reactions are harnessed in heat packs and combustion engines, while endothermic reactions are used in processes like
        photosynthesis and certain industrial applications.<br><br></div>
